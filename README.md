Papeles
=======

Papeles is a document management program targeted towards scientists,
students and other people who read scientific papers.  The end goal is
to make finding, storing, and reading articles as painless and enjoyable
as possible.  Many of the concepts behind Papeles were inspired by
[Papers](http://mekentosj.com/papers/), a program of a similar nature
for Mac and iPhone, by Mekentosj.

Papeles runs on [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/), uses GTK+ and is
open source.
