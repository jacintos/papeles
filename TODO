Critical:
 * Page caching. Currently, all pages in the document are loaded into an HBox, which is stored inside
   a Scrolled Window. This is pretty lame. I know.
 * Store and retrieve XMP metadata.
 * I18n.

General:
 * Support PostScript files.
 * Drag'n'drop document importing.
 * Split code into functional assemblies and minimize the amount of code that must be GPL (i.e.
   should probably be limited to GUI-related code).
 * Plugin framework using Mono.Addins.
 * Document search using Beagle or Tracker.
 * Use GIO (gio-sharp) to get icon based on mime-type for right panel. It might be best to wait for
   GTK# 2.14 when it is stable.

Import:
 * Import information from RIS files.
 * Import information from BibTex.

Integration:
 * PubMed integration (possibly augmented some by HubMed).
 * PLoS integration.
 * ArXiv integration.
 * Scopus integration.
 * Search CiteSeer.
 * Google Scholar integration.
